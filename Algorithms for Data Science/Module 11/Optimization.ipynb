    "## Mathematical Representation?\n",

    "Maximize $f(x)$ or Minimize $f(x)$\n",

    "Here, $x$ represents the vector of decision variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Linear Optimization \n",
    "   \n",
    "   If both the objective function and the constraints are linear, the problem is a linear optimization problem. Linear optimization problems can be solved using methods like the simplex method or interior-point methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: \\\n",
    "   Maximize $c^Tx$ \\\n",
    "   Subject to $Ax \\leq b, x \\geq 0$\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Nonlinear Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "   When the objective function or constraints involve nonlinear equations, the problem becomes nonlinear optimization. Nonlinear optimization problems are generally more challenging and require iterative methods to find solutions. Methods like gradient descent, Newton's method, or genetic algorithms are used to solve nonlinear optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: \\\n",
    "   Maximize $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5$ \\\n",
    "   Subject to $g(x) = x^2 - 4 \\leq 0$ \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integer optimization\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In integer optimization, some or all of the decision variables are required to be integers. Integer optimization problems are commonly encountered in discrete optimization scenarios like combinatorial optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: \\\n",
    "   Maximize $c^Tx$ \\\n",
