    "\n",
    "In this problem you will be designing an intelligent algorithm to replace missing values in datasets, often referred to as imputation. The choice of imputation method can significantly affect the performance of subsequent analyses so keep this in mind. The dataset needs to be selected from the Kaggle or similar data repository."

    "Overall both imputation methods work well to rid the dataset of NaN values which then allow for running machine learning algorithms. The Random forest imputer does a better job overall comapred to the simple imputer that only uses the mean/median/mode. Intuitively this makes sense as the Random forest imputer trains a random forest regression model for each column to the predict what the nan values should be in that column. This allows for better NaN replacement as it learns a relationhip within the data that it can exploit. The simple imputer can only replace the NaNs with a single method and thus lacks reliability with edge case values that might be outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods are powerful and should be used according to your use case. On complex data sets a more advanced algorithm might be beneficial since it can generally be more accurate. For a smaller dataset a simpler technique might work better. If time cosntraints are a concern then simpler methods tend to work much better and are faster overall."
